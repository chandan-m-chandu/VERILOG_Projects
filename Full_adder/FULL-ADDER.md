This project implements a Full Adder using Verilog, a combinational logic circuit that performs the addition of three bits(two significant bits and an input carry bit). It produces two outputs:
> Sum (Y) : The result of adding the three bits.
> 
> Carry Cout: The carry bit produced during the addition.


- Takes three input bits: `A`, `B`, and `Cin` (Carry input).
- Outputs a sum `Y` and a carry  `Cout` .
